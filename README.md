# MyC

This is a very disorganized repository containg some good and other not so good C programs that I either wrote myself or got as part of the course
material in COMP10002 at University of Melbourne in Sem-2 2015.
Some of these programs are actually really useful and the code in the assignments is something I was kind of proud od after writing them, 
because of how the organization in my code more than the actual complexity of the code.
