Exercise 13.2

Using w_s=1 bit for a sign, w_e=3 bits for a exponent, and w_m=12
bits for a mantissa (as in Table 13.4): 

2.0 = 0.5 x 2^2 = 0.1 (binary) x 2^{10} (binary)
	s = 0
	e = 010
	m = 1000 0000 0000

	So overall, 0010 1000 0000 0000, or 2800 hexadecimal

(note that in this simple example representation the first bit of the
mantissa will always be one, because of the binary normalization, but
is being stored too, wasting a bit.)

-2.5 = - 0.625 x 2^2 = 0.101 (binary) x 2^{10} (binary)
	s = 1
	e = 010
	m = 1010 0000 0000

	So overall, 1010 1010 0000 0000, or AA00 hexadecimal

7.875 = 0.984375 x 2^3 = 0.111111 (binary) x 2^{11} (binary)
	s = 0
	e = 011
	m = 1111 1100 0000

	So overall, 0011 1111 1100 0000, or 3FC0 hexadecimal
