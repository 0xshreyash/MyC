sadness and regret was in me. To what place he drove, or how long it

a boat near by, as if waiting for us. I had never seen so much water; it

S4: line   759, score =  0.000

sped and shimmered in the moonlight far from shore, and beyond was the

S2: line   761, score =  2.000

and our boat creaked and swerved in roaring currents, and the boatman

I handed him the gold watch and chain which had belonged to my father,

He fastened the chain upon his waistcoat, mounted the steps, rapped, and

smooth road. The moon had set, and we could not see our way. Bony let

the first leap in a wild run. For half a minute we were in a bad mess,

S2: line   818, score =  3.000
S4: line   818, score =  0.238

we flew down the dark road, our front wheels leaving ground with every

appalled me; it was the mask of horror. But the glimpse he got of my own

visage in the dim match-light had a worse effect upon him. He really saw

Bony shouted like one in authority, and they let us pass. We found the

rope-walker in a small tent near the edge of the precipice. He was

S4: line  2416, score =  0.240

a big, brawny Frenchman, who reminded me of the picture of Goliath

confronted by David in my bedchamber at home. He surveyed me from

head to foot while Bony called some one aside--it was a man I became

S2: line  2419, score =  2.000
S4: line  2419, score =  0.000

acquainted with in due time--and addressed him confidentially. Looking

S4: line  2420, score =  0.000

out, I could see the long rope dipping low in the chasm from the cliff's

S4: line  2421, score =  0.000

edge and ascending to the farther shore; I could hear the roar of the

S2: line  2422, score =  2.000
S4: line  2422, score =  0.000

rapids far below us, and felt a little tremor inside of me. Really,

S2: line  2423, score =  2.000
S4: line  2423, score =  0.000

now that I had a chance to make her and all the world wonder at me, I

S2: line  2424, score =  2.000
S4: line  2424, score =  0.000

thought of backing out. However, I was not brave enough for that.

The great man came presently, and took hold of my arms and lifted me as

S4: line  2427, score =  0.000

if I had been a sack of potatoes. It seemed revolting, I remember, to

S2: line  2428, score =  3.000
S4: line  2428, score =  0.239

be so handled, for, clearly, he had no respect for me, and with good
S1: line  2429, bytes = 69
S2: line  2429, score =  2.000
S4: line  2429, score =  0.000

reason. He said that he would try me when the rope was ready, and did,
S1: line  2430, bytes = 71
S2: line  2430, score =  2.000
S4: line  2430, score =  0.000

and said I would do. Bony and I went outside the tent and saw the

S2: line  2431, score =  3.000
S4: line  2431, score =  0.241

great rope being tightened with horse and capstan. It lay almost level,

S2: line  2432, score =  3.000
S4: line  2432, score =  0.238

by-and-by, in a long, sweeping curve that could have gone to the moon,

S4: line  2433, score =  0.000

I fancy, if its circle had been completed. The Frenchman came out of his

tent presently, in tights and shoulder-braces of new leather, upon

S2: line  2435, score =  3.000
S4: line  2435, score =  0.240

which two loops or handles had been fastened, one over each shoulder.

He carefully examined the capstan and the pawls beneath it. He spoke

a swift word or two in French, whereupon a young man, who acted as

S4: line  2438, score =  0.000

interpreter, requested me to remove my boots, and I did so. Then the

S4: line  2439, score =  0.000

performer stepped in front of me, and, reaching backward over his body,

S2: line  2440, score =  2.000
S4: line  2440, score =  0.000

took my hands in his. I jumped to his back and caught the loops over my
S1: line  2441, bytes = 72
S2: line  2441, score =  2.000
S4: line  2441, score =  0.000

wrists and clung to the leathern braces, while he carefully placed my
S1: line  2442, bytes = 70
S2: line  2442, score =  2.000
S4: line  2442, score =  0.000

feet on his hips.

The big Frenchman took a few paces and began to chatter.

"Loosen up a little," said the interpreter. "Don't stand so stiff.

S2: line  2447, score =  2.000
S4: line  2447, score =  0.000

There, that's better."

An attendant brought the balancing-rod, and the performer took it and
S1: line  2450, bytes = 70
S2: line  2450, score =  3.000
S4: line  2450, score =  0.239

approached the end of the rope. I could now look down far into the abyss
S1: line  2451, bytes = 73
S2: line  2451, score =  2.000
S4: line  2451, score =  0.000
---
and felt my heart failing me. But I thought of Jo, and imagined that she
S1: line  2452, bytes = 73
S2: line  2452, score =  2.000
S4: line  2452, score =  0.000
---
was there, and said to myself that I would rather die than be a coward.
S1: line  2453, bytes = 72
S2: line  2453, score =  2.000
S4: line  2453, score =  0.000
---
Before I knew it he was on the slant of the rope and slowly descending,
S1: line  2454, bytes = 72
S2: line  2454, score =  2.000
S4: line  2454, score =  0.000

and so silently it seemed as if he were walking the soft air. I heard a
S1: line  2455, bytes = 72
S2: line  2455, score =  2.000
S4: line  2455, score =  0.000

murmur start suddenly, and go up and down the shore near us. The roar of
S1: line  2456, bytes = 73
S2: line  2456, score =  2.000
S4: line  2456, score =  0.000

the waters burst upon me from below. I knew that there was plenty of
S1: line  2457, bytes = 69
S2: line  2457, score =  2.000
S4: line  2457, score =  0.000

air beneath us, but was not brave enough to look down through that long,
S1: line  2458, bytes = 73
S2: line  2458, score =  2.000
S4: line  2458, score =  0.000

long drop to the foamy water-floor of the chasm. I kept my eyes on the
S1: line  2459, bytes = 71
S2: line  2459, score =  2.000
S4: line  2459, score =  0.000

tree-top at the edge of the farther cliff. I heard a voice call to me:
S1: line  2460, bytes = 71
S2: line  2460, score =  2.000
S4: line  2460, score =  0.000

S1: line  2461, bytes =  1
S2: line  2461, score =  0.000
S4: line  2461, score =  0.000

"Are you afraid?"
S1: line  2462, bytes = 18
S2: line  2462, score =  1.000
S4: line  2462, score =  0.000

S2: line  2463, score =  0.000
S4: line  2463, score =  0.000

I shook my head and answered, "No."
S1: line  2464, bytes = 36
S2: line  2464, score =  2.000

The performer stopped and began to sway a little, his rod moving up and
S1: line  2466, bytes = 72
S2: line  2466, score =  2.000
S4: line  2466, score =  0.000

down. I tightened my grip and breathed faster. I remember well the play
S1: line  2467, bytes = 72
S2: line  2467, score =  3.000
S4: line  2467, score =  0.475

of his muscles under me. I could feel a change in their action--he was
S1: line  2468, bytes = 71
S2: line  2468, score =  2.000
S4: line  2468, score =  0.000
---
going backward, but very slowly. The roar of the water was diminishing,
S1: line  2469, bytes = 72
S2: line  2469, score =  2.000
S4: line  2469, score =  0.000
---
and stopped as suddenly as it began. We were back on the earth again,
S1: line  2470, bytes = 70
S2: line  2470, score =  2.000
S4: line  2470, score =  0.000

and I was very glad and a little shaky.
S1: line  2471, bytes = 40
S2: line  2471, score =  2.000
S4: line  2471, score =  0.000

S1: line  2472, bytes =  1
S2: line  2472, score =  0.000
S4: line  2472, score =  0.000
---
Well, the Frenchman said that I would do, and half a dozen men shook my
S1: line  2473, bytes = 72
S2: line  2473, score =  2.000
S4: line  2473, score =  0.000

hand and made me proud with their compliments. The interpreter told me
S1: line  2474, bytes = 71
S2: line  2474, score =  2.000
S4: line  2474, score =  0.000
---
that we would "cross the bridge" at three, and that I should wait there
S1: line  2475, bytes = 72
S2: line  2475, score =  2.000
S4: line  2475, score =  0.000
---
and have my dinner with them. The big Frenchman put on his clothes and
S1: line  2476, bytes = 71
S2: line  2476, score =  2.000
S4: line  2476, score =  0.000

drove away in a carriage.
S1: line  2477, bytes = 26
S2: line  2477, score =  1.000
S4: line  2477, score =  0.000

S2: line  2478, score =  0.000
S4: line  2478, score =  0.000

Those hours of waiting were a great trial to me. I paced up and down
S1: line  2479, bytes = 69
S2: line  2479, score =  2.000
S4: line  2479, score =  0.000

before the tent, and Bony tried to talk to me, but I said little and
S1: line  2480, bytes = 69
S2: line  2480, score =  3.000
S4: line  2480, score =  0.239
---
heard less. I remember his telling in a whisper that they would not take
S1: line  2481, bytes = 73
S2: line  2481, score =  3.000
S4: line  2481, score =  0.237
---
a boy so young without the consent of his parents, and that he had told
S1: line  2482, bytes = 72
S2: line  2482, score =  2.000
S4: line  2482, score =  0.000
---
them that he was my father. I assured him, with dignity, that I would
S1: line  2483, bytes = 70
S2: line  2483, score =  2.000
S4: line  2483, score =  0.000

not lie about it.

"Just say nothing. I'll do all the lying that's necessary," said Bony.

"If they ask me I shall tell the truth," I affirmed.

S1: line  2490, bytes = 71
S2: line  2490, score =  2.000
S4: line  2490, score =  0.000

Bony pleaded.

I made no answer, but somehow his words had cheapened the enterprise, of
S1: line  2493, bytes = 73
S2: line  2493, score =  2.000
S4: line  2493, score =  0.000

which I had had no high opinion since the performer had lifted me as if
S1: line  2494, bytes = 72
S2: line  2494, score =  2.000
S4: line  2494, score =  0.000

I were a thing.

The edges of the cliffs began to turn black with people, and I could

S2: line  2497, score =  2.000
S4: line  2497, score =  0.000

hear the sound of many voices. Suddenly those near us began cheering.

S2: line  2498, score =  2.000
S4: line  2498, score =  0.000

The great Frenchman had returned. It was about three o'clock. He came
S1: line  2499, bytes = 70
S2: line  2499, score =  2.000
S4: line  2499, score =  0.000

straight to me, and shook my hand, and said in French, "_Courage!_" and
S1: line  2500, bytes = 72
S2: line  2500, score =  2.000
S4: line  2500, score =  0.000

added something which I could not understand.

S2: line  2508, score =  3.000

and I drew them on.

cheer. He tried his pole, and then came straight to me. That was a bad

S4: line  2513, score =  0.000

moment, and I felt like running for my life, but--no--I could not do

so now. The interpreter asked me to remove my coat and put on a

In a second we were on the rope, and he began reaching for his balance.

S2: line  2518, score =  2.000

He felt his way slowly.

The people were cheering and waving their handkerchiefs. The bands

ceased playing. He quickened his pace, and went on with a steady stride.

S2: line  2522, score =  2.000
S4: line  2522, score =  0.000

A roar of excitement followed the cheering, and then a hush fell on

S2: line  2523, score =  2.000
S4: line  2523, score =  0.000

the crowds. For half a moment I could hear only the breathing of the

performer and my own heart-beat. Then I heard the snort of the "white

horses" far below me. Suddenly the shrill, hysterical cry of a woman

S2: line  2526, score =  2.000
S4: line  2526, score =  0.000

rose out of the silence. Right after that I could hear the groans of men

S2: line  2527, score =  2.000
S4: line  2527, score =  0.000

behind us, and wild peals of laughter that echoed through the deep chasm

S2: line  2528, score =  2.000
S4: line  2528, score =  0.000

and had a weird note in them.

There were those for whom the sight of our peril was as a nightmare.

Phrases of prayer came out to my ears--"God have mercy on them," and

the like. Little children called to us. There were two or three men who

S2: line  2533, score =  2.000
S4: line  2533, score =  0.000

groaned at every step of the walker, as if they felt the strain of his

muscles. It was an old Roman spectacle, and at no other time in the

I had kept my eyes on the tree-top, and now I could see the lift of

S2: line  2538, score =  1.000
S4: line  2538, score =  0.000

the rope before me; I could hear it creak as it bent beneath us. For an

S2: line  2539, score =  2.000
S4: line  2539, score =  0.000

instant I let my glance fall. Down, down it went like a plummet

S2: line  2540, score =  2.000
S4: line  2540, score =  0.000

sounding the depths below. I shut my eyes, but my thoughts went plunging

S2: line  2541, score =  2.000
S4: line  2541, score =  0.000

downward. I was like a man with his hands full of eggs--one falls, and

S2: line  2542, score =  1.000
S4: line  2542, score =  0.000

then they all begin to slip away.

When I looked again the cliffs were reeling before us. I had to stop

S2: line  2545, score =  2.000
S4: line  2545, score =  0.000

them, single-handed, and I can tell you it was a task. With a mighty

S2: line  2546, score =  2.000
S4: line  2546, score =  0.000

effort I shoved them back into place again and held them down--at least,

S2: line  2547, score =  1.000
S4: line  2547, score =  0.000

that is the way I thought of it.

We were down in the hollow of the rope, about half-way across the chasm,

S2: line  2550, score =  2.000
S4: line  2550, score =  0.000

and were swinging a little in a wind current. The Frenchman slowed his

S2: line  2551, score =  2.000
S4: line  2551, score =  0.000

pace, and I could feel the changing tension of his muscles. He struck

S2: line  2552, score =  3.000
S4: line  2552, score =  0.239

the rope with one foot and then the other--a sort of hammer blow. It

S2: line  2553, score =  2.000
S4: line  2553, score =  0.000

checked the swing, and for half a second he seemed to cling with his

S2: line  2554, score =  1.000
S4: line  2554, score =  0.000

feet. He took three quick steps, and settled into an even pace again. I

S2: line  2555, score =  2.000
S4: line  2555, score =  0.000

thought of letting go, for the relief of it. But this notion came to me,

S2: line  2556, score =  2.000
S4: line  2556, score =  0.000

and I laugh when I think of its oddity: if I should let go I should lose

S2: line  2557, score =  2.000
S4: line  2557, score =  0.000

the fifty dollars, which would buy something fine for my mother. And I

S2: line  2558, score =  2.000
S4: line  2558, score =  0.000

clung so that my hands ached. I watched a swallow, and ceased to think

S2: line  2559, score =  1.000
S4: line  2559, score =  0.000

of myself. That little bird may have saved my life, for me and for

you. He coasted through the sunlit air almost to the point of my nose,
S1: line  2561, bytes = 71
S2: line  2561, score =  2.000
S4: line  2561, score =  0.000

checked himself with a giggle of surprise, and wound us in loops of

S2: line  2562, score =  1.000
S4: line  2562, score =  0.000

song. Somehow it heartened me to hear him.

The rope grew steeper. Now it seemed an impossible journey there ahead

of us. But he went on with a steady stride, and the hempen hill bent

S2: line  2566, score =  2.000
S4: line  2566, score =  0.000

inward as he put his feet upon it. With joy I could see my tree-top

S2: line  2567, score =  2.000
S4: line  2567, score =  0.000

coming nearer, but every step I had to look up a little farther to see

S2: line  2568, score =  2.000
S4: line  2568, score =  0.000

it. Suddenly the rope began to swing again--I do not know why. It has

S2: line  2569, score =  2.000
S4: line  2569, score =  0.000

been said that some reckless fellow had wilfully pulled a guy-rope. The

S4: line  2570, score =  0.000

whole side of the cliff began to rock as before. The strands of muscle

S4: line  2571, score =  0.000

under me tightened quickly. The performer slowed his pace, and stopped

S2: line  2572, score =  3.000
S4: line  2572, score =  0.238

for half a second. The ends of his pole went up and down like a

teeter-board. Again his feet struck the rope.

He took two or three quick steps and stopped again. He had checked the

swing of the rope, and now resumed his progress up the steep hill. He

S2: line  2579, score =  2.000
S4: line  2579, score =  0.000

climbed slowly near the end of it, and a mighty cheer ran up and down

covered my face and wept. Then there was a great chattering in French,

before me, staring into my face. Grievous and heavy was my sense of
